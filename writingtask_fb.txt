Dream job
Hello my name is Balazs Forgo and I am studying Full stack developer which is my dreamjob.
I am in love with the informatics and looking forward to the future technologies. 
With this in mind I did not hesitate when I started my journey in Kando.
In the near future I want to be a full stack developer in short. I could make anything with a team or without.
As a fullstack developer I could work from home and in a flexible working hour. 83
Biggest advantage is the shortage of fullstack programmers, so that means I have the chance to choose   
where I want to work and with whom, and if I ever want to leave I will just find another job. 
If I ever need to explain why they are so rare because the full stack developer can do anything for example database development 
or frontend development.
I am not as enthusiastic to a have a motto, 
but here is an Einstein motto: "Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value"
